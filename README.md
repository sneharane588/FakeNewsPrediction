# Fake News Prediction
#### To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.
#### Using sklearn, build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model.

There are more than millions of news contents published on the internet every day. If we include the tweets from twitter, then this figure will be increased in multiples. Nowadays, the internet is becoming the biggest source of spreading fake news. A mechanism is required to identify fake news published on the internet so that the readers can be warned accordingly. Some researchers have proposed the methods to identify fake news by analyzing the text data of the news based on the machine learning techniques. Here, we will also discuss the machine learning techniques that can identify fake news correctly.
